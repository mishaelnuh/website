Presentation given at The Thirteenth International Conference on [Computational Structures Technology](http://www.cstconference.com). Performed verification of the novel Hybrid Panel Trust Element (HyPT) developed at the University of Toronto using large scale structures. Three groups of structures were modeled:

- A shear-critical two-storey frame specimen tested by Duong
- A series of coupling beam tested by Fischer
- Shear walls constructed out of the modeled coupling beams

Results show that the element is generally able to capture the behaviour of the specimens accurately, capturing both the critical failure mode, peak load, as well as displacements with a relatively short computation time compared to conventional, low-powered FEM meshes.
