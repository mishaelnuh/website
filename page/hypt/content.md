Performed as part of a research internship at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Prof. Michael P. Collins and Prof. Evan C. Bentz.

Performed verification of a novel finite element developed at the University of Toronto against two databases of concrete beam tests published by ACI. Results show that the element is able to conservatively predict the failure loads of the beams.
