The Automating Concrete Construction (ACORN) project is a UKRI funded initiative carried out by the University of Bath, University of Cambridge, and University of Dundee. As part of the project, a demonstrator thin-shell flooring system (called the OAK) was developed leveraging a novel digital fabrication technique. The system presents a sustainable alternative to conventional floor slabs through drastic material, weight, and carbon reductions.
