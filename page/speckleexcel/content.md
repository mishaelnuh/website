SpeckleExcel is part of the [Speckle](https://speckle.systems) open source project: a data platform for the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. It is a client which allows data to be sent to and from SpeckleServers to Microsoft Excel. Combined with other connecters available (e.g., SpeckleRhino, SpeckleRevit, etc.), SpeckleExcel allows users to work with the software they wish to use, free from the constraints imposed by file-based workflows.
