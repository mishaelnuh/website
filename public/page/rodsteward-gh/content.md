RodSteward-GH is a Grasshopper plugin based on the [RodSteward](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/projects/rodsteward/) software package by Alec Jacobson. It allows users to create and generate structures constructed with rods and 3D printed parts. RodSteward-GH is being developed as part of my bachelor's thesis.

The plugin takes either a mesh or a series of lines as inputs and outputs the following:
- STL files of joints for 3D printing
- Lengths of rods used
- Laser cutting plan of rods

RodSteward-GH is also able to help users assemble the structure by providing sequencing for the parts by the rod lengths and joint labels.
