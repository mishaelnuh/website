Automated Robotic Concrete Spraying (ARCS) is a fabrication process that was developed to create curved concrete shells. Using a robotic arm and a glass fibre reinforced concrete spraying machine, cementitious material can be deposited onto a curved base formed by a shape-reconfigurable pin-bed to create curved concrete shells.

The fabrication method was developed as part of the [Automating Concrete Construction](https://automated.construction) project and was used to fabricate a novel thin-shell floor system.
